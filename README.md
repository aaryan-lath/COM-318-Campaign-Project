# COM-318-Campaign-Project -- Part 1

# Increasing federal funding for NASA is the subject I have selected for this campaign. NASA is essential to the advancement of science, the development of new technologies, and the solution of some of the most important problems facing humanity. Even while NASA makes a lot of contributions, its budget is a measly 0.4 per cent of all federal spending (StarTalk). In addition to space exploration, increasing NASA's budget would support technical advancement, economic expansion, environmental preservation, and educational inspiration.
 

# NASA has continuously produced significant returns in the form of technical advancements, scientific discoveries, and economic effect that spans several industries. Convincing lawmakers that more money for NASA is a wise investment in the nation's and the world's future will be the main goal of my campaign (Rober, 2018). Given that NASA's mission extends well beyond space exploration, it merits greater attention. A Space Foundation research from 2022 states that up to $10 in economic benefits are produced for every dollar invested in NASA (Space Foundation, 2022). NASA's research has produced innovations that have advanced industries like telecommunications, medicine, and climate science. NASA would be better equipped to handle urgent problems like disaster relief, climate change monitoring, and international communication if its budget were increased.

# Audience and Communication Plan
# Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives will be the campaign's main target audience. These legislators have direct control over NASA's yearly budget and are susceptible to persuasive arguments supported by thorough research and evidence. Because they have the power to give NASA more funding and because many of them are interested in projects that improve technology, national security, and economic growth, this audience is perfect. Research shows that legislators are more likely to act on an issue if they see broad public support, and from a survey conducted by Pew Research 79% of Democrats and 71% of Republicans have a favourable opinion of NASA with only 9% of everyone surveyed having an unfavourable view (Atske).

# Targeted emails to congressional staffers, public engagement social media campaigns, and collaborations with science advocacy organisations will all be used to promote the website. The objective is to develop a coherent and convincing story that highlights the real advantages of NASA's efforts.

# To effectively persuade politicians, the website will employ persuasive arguments, statistics, and real-world applications of NASA's research. The website will feature:
# •	Economic Impact Reports - Showcases NASA's contributions to employment development and technological progress (NASA).
# •	National Security Advantages - Describes how NASA assists military and defence breakthroughs. This will be one of the main reasons why the persuasion will work since the National Academies of Sciences emphasise how crucial it is to keep funding space research in order to preserve American leadership in innovation and technology worldwide. Invoking the patriotism within the legislators will be one of my main goals.
# •	Environmental and Climate Data - Highlights NASA's involvement in monitoring climate change and natural disasters.
# •	Public Engagement Tools - Enables citizens to submit automated letters to their representatives in support of higher NASA funding.
